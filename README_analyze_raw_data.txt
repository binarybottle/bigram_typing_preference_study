Notes on non-Prolific raw data analysis:

- 1-key errors: X followed by V, Q, D, Z, F, E, S, W, C, A, R (no error data)

- 2-key errors: XS followed by VE, QF, AX, ZX, ZV, ZF, FC, VX, SW, SD,...

- 1-key vs. 2-key error rates are as expected.
  If the 1st-to-2nd key transition is easier than average,
  it will lie to the left side, otherwise to the right side. 

- 1-key vs. 2-key typing times are as similarly expected.
  If the 1st-to-2nd key transition is easier than average,
  it will lie to the left side, otherwise to the right side. 

- 1-key error-rate vs. typing time: X is a high-error outlier.

- 2-key error-rate vs. typing time: High-error outliers include: XS, VE, QF, AX, ZX, ZV, ZF, and FC.

- Right-hand errors are very high for lowercase L and J because they look like "i".
    - Poor choice of font in study
    - Good that we're focusing on left hand typing
